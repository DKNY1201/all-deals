Walmart Discount Tips
Walmart is known for their affordable goods, but there are still ways you can save even more money. Walmer offers a variety of in-store and instant online coupons for everything from groceries to clothes to furniture, plus you may even find Walmart photo coupons, oil change coupons and other discounts on a variety of Walmart services.

How to Save at Walmart

Take advantage of Walmart’s price matching policy, wherein Walmart will match any current published sale, as well as prices from certain online retailers (including Walmart.com, which often has lower prices than in the store).
Download Walmart’s mobile app and use the Savings Catcher, especially if you don’t want to go through the trouble of comparing prices. This feature lets you scan your receipt and then it checks top competitor prices on the items you bought. If lower prices are found elsewhere, they will send you a gift card for the difference. The Walmart app also allows you to browse and print photos, search for pharmacy discounts and see other deals around the store.
Get to know Walmart’s coupon policy. To start, there are no Walmart promo codes or coupon codes for use online, though you can get printable coupons online for use in-store. Additionally, you can’t stack Walmart coupons, but they will pay cash if you find a coupon worth more than the item costs, which can happen if the item is already on sale. Finally, shoppers can use multiple coupons if you meet the requirements for each coupon, but they do not accept competitor coupons.
Check out the robust Walmart rollback and clearance sections, which often boast savings of anywhere from a few dollars on everyday items to hundreds of dollars on big ticket electronics.
Opt for one of Walmart’s free shipping opportunities. You can earn free shipping if you spend at least $35 on your order, or just ship your items to your local Walmart for free pickup. Additionally, you can filter your search on Walmart.com to include only items that offer free two-day shipping, of which there are millions on the site.
Consider a Walmart credit card, which earns you a $25 statement credit when you spend $75 on the day you’re approved. Plus, you’ll save 5 cents a gallon at Walmart gas stations and get special financing offers.
Walmart Layaway

During the holiday shopping season, specifically from September 2 to December 12, Walmart allows layaway purchases in select categories, including electronics, toys, furniture and appliances. Just make a small down payment at the Pickup Desk and the pay the full amount later.

Walmart Warranty

The Walmart return policy is quite generous, allowing up to 90 days for returns with or without a receipt. However, certain items, including cell phones, computers and video game hardware do require a receipt and must be returned within two weeks. Additionally, firearms, gas-powered minibikes, diabetic products and other similar products cannot be returned.');
